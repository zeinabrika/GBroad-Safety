In 2017 around 24,831 injuries in road reported to police in UK. However, because of changes in system for reporting by police comparison of this figure should be interpreted with caution.
This project provides the traffic accidents in Great Britain that were reported by the police in 2017. It includes number of accident severity in GB. 
The data and information used for statistics and collected by police force in different area in UK. 
These files provide detailed data about the circumstances of injury road accidents in Great Britain, the types of vehicles involved and the consequential casualties. 
The statistics relate only to personal injury accidents on public roads that are reported to the police, and subsequently recorded, using the STATS19 accident reporting form. 
Now a day, because massive amount of data using traditional way for data analysis is not enough.
Big data can be a way to solve this problem by requiring high volume, velocity, value, veracity and have a new high-performance processing of data analysis. 
Addressing big data is one of time-consuming task and it needs a large computational infrastructure to ensure successful data processing and analysis.
Big data by using distributed storage, parallel processing and ability to process every type of data can pass through the challenges of data analysis. 
Big data analysis more focused on developments on different big data framework, such as Hadoop, Spark and some families of data pre-processing methods and applications on new big data learning paradigms.
